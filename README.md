# terminalEnv
A terminal shell environment with support for a few other programs written in Python - should work on any Unix-based Operating System. Sort of like a terminal-desktop environment?!

When you run the program, it launches you straight into the app launcher, where you can run many apps (most of them aren't completed yet), including a terminal shell, calendar, file browser, task monitor, etc.

# Contributing
I am looking for contributers to help with this project, especially with things like the applications (or anything else you would like to help with), because there are quite a few of them to do.

## Here is a list of planned apps, and whether they have been completed:
* Terminal Shell (Mostly Completed)
* Text Editor (Not Started)
* File Browser (Not Started)
* Games Library (Not Started)
* Settings (Not Started)

## Here is a list of potential ideas for the future:
* Calendar
* Web Browser
* Email Client
* Task Monitor
* Development Library (Not sure how to do it yet, but maybe a python library (canvas.py or something to link up to automatically) where you can create graphical programs with the program.)
