# terminalEnv
A terminal shell environment with support for a few other programs written in Python - should work on any Unix-based Operating System. Sort of like a terminal-desktop environment?!

When you run the program, it launches you straight into the app launcher, where you can run many apps (most of them aren't completed yet), including a terminal shell, calendar, file browser, task monitor, etc.

# Contributing
I am looking for contributers to help with this project, with things like the applications (or anything else you would like to help with), because there are quite a few of them to do.
